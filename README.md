# IC-FERSR-REACT

## Overview

This repository contains the principle source API code for coupling `IC-FERST` (Imperial College Finite
Element Reservoir SimulaTor), a next generation three-dimensional (3D) reservoir simulator
based on the Double-Control-Volume Finite Element methods and dynamic unstructured mesh
optimization, with `PHREEQCRM`, a state-of-the-art geochemical package.

`IC-FERST` is developed by Imperial College London and `PHREEQCRM` is developed by the United Stated Geological Survey (USGS).
